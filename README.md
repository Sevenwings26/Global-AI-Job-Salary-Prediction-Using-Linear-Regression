# üíº Global AI Job Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression

Data Source: `kaggle.com`

> Predicting annual salary in USD based on job features like title, experience level, and location.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to build a **Linear Regression** model that predicts job salaries in USD using various job-related features such as:

- Job title  
- Experience level  
- Years of experience  
- Employment type  
- Remote ratio  
- Education level  
- Industry  
- Company size  

The goal is to help candidates, HR professionals, and job boards estimate salary ranges for tech-related roles using historical job posting data.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key EDA steps included:

- Distribution of salaries across job titles and experience levels
- Correlation between numeric features (e.g., experience vs salary)
- Boxplots of salary by employment type and company size
- Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables
